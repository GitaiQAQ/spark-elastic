## Integration of Elasticsearch with Apache Spark

This project shows how to easily integrate [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org), a fast and general purpose engine for 
large-scale data processing, with [Elasticsearch](http://elasticsearch.org), a real-time distributed search and analytics 
engine.

Spark is an in-memory processing framework and outperforms Hadoop up to a factor of 100. Spark is accompanied by 

* [MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/mllib/), a scalable machine learning library,
* [Spark SQL](https://spark.apache.org/sql/), a unified access platform for structured big data,
* [Spark Streaming](https://spark.apache.org/streaming/), a library to build scalable fault-tolerant streaming applications.

Combining Apache Spark and Elasticsearch brings the power of machine learning, real-time data sources such as social media and 
more to an Enterprise Search Platform.
